           <h2> Description </h2>
           Our project, Computer Vision Indentification
           for Smart Bird Feeders, will encourage the expansion of the bird-enthusiast
           community. We will be creating a web application for David Plemmons,
           the owner and creator of pEEp bird feeders.
           We will be implementing an AI model that will be able to indentify
           species of birds from the photos provided by the pEEp bird feeder. As
           well as creating an easy way to share user images.

           <h2> Requirements </h2>
           Ability to automatically identify bird species. <br>
           Image organization that allows for
           photo sharing, image capturing, and naming of the bird species. <br>
           Forums and online sharing for user submitted data,
           to further build the bird-enthusiast community.

           <div class = "col-md-6 projectPar" id = "Limitations">
           <h2> Limitations </h2>
           The current limitations are not having a reliable way to indentify bird
           species from the photos taken by the pEEp bird feeder. Meaning,
           users do not have an expert to confirm their bird classifications.
           Additionally, there is no organizational system for the users to share
           their images. Lastly, users are unable to track individual birds who could
           possibly be frequent visitors.

           <h2> Solution </h2>
           Our solution is to develop a web application for David that is a easily
           navigable for users. Additionally, we will be implementing an AI model that can
           identify bird species.
